TL;DR: './script/server' and go to http://127.0.0.1:3000

If you want to configure the app, keep on reading. Configure parameters are in
config/config.yml. This file is in yaml. No parameters are mandatory. The
parameters that can be set are:

port: number
detach: true|false
google_key: string
calendar_url: string

For example:

port: 3000
detach: true
google_key: "XXX"
calendar_url: "http://www.google.com/calendar/XXX"

The port determines the port in which the server will listen, while detach
determines if the server detaches as a daemon or not. The other two
increase/decrease functionality. The google_key will allow you to use google
maps to put data points in the notes. To get a key you must sign in at [1] You
have to use your google identity and subscribe the key for a particular server.
I have selected one for myself for the server at 127.0.0.1 which is good enough
for this application. The calendar url can be found in [2] and follow the
procedure. Dont get the frame, just the url loaded in the frame.

Finally, to run

./script/server
