TL;DR

rake db:gitdb:drop db:gitdb:create db:gitdb:common
./script/server
go to http://127.0.0.1:3000

If you want to configure the app, keep on reading. Configure parameters are in
config/config.yml. This file is in yaml. No parameters are mandatory. The
parameters that can be set are:

port: number
detach: true|false
google_key: string
calendar_url: string
debug: true|false
gitdb: string

For example:

port: 3000
detach: true
debug: true
gitdb: "/home/user/gitdb"
google_key: "XXX"
calendar_url: "http://www.google.com/calendar/XXX"

The port determines the port in which the server will listen, while detach
determines if the server detaches as a daemon or not. The debug boolean
variable (if set to false) just allows the hooking of a particular function to
the window.error function, so that errors are shown with our notice library. If
you set it to true, the error will not be captured by ourselves, but rather by
Firebug or your debugger, therefore allowing a better debugging experience.
The gitdb value may be a directory where you want to store your data. If you
do not set it, it will be assumed to be the db directory inside the RAILS_ROOT
directory.

The other two increase/decrease functionality. The google_key will allow you to
use google maps to put data points in the notes. To get a key you must sign in
at [1]. You have to use your google identity and subscribe the key for a
particular server. I have selected one for myself for the server at 127.0.0.1
which is good enough for this application. The calendar url can be found in [2]
and follow the procedure. Dont get the frame, just the url loaded in the frame.

The first time you run it you must create the database. This is easily done
with rake tasks. The following one:

rake db:gitdb:create

is the only mandatory one, since it will create the git structure and insert
the necessary tags for this application to work. The following command

rake db:gitdb:common

will insert more tags into the database, some of which seem useful to me (you
can skip it if you do not want them). Finally you can delete the whole database
by ussuing a

rake db:gitdb:drop

To run

./script/server
