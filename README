TL;DR

rake db:gitdb:drop db:gitdb:create db:gitdb:common
./script/server
go to http://127.0.0.1:3000

If you want to configure the app, keep on reading. Configure parameters are in
config/config.yml. This file is in yaml. No parameters are mandatory. The
parameters that can be set are:

port: number
detach: true|false
google_key: string
calendar_url: string
debug: true|false

For example:

port: 3000
detach: true
debug: true
google_key: "XXX"
calendar_url: "http://www.google.com/calendar/XXX"

The port determines the port in which the server will listen, while detach
determines if the server detaches as a daemon or not. The debug boolean
variable (if set to false) just allows the hooking of a particular function to
the window.error function, so that errors are shown with our notice library. If
you set it to true, the error will not be captured by ourselves, but rather by
Firebug or your debugger, therefore allowing a better debugging experience.

The other two increase/decrease functionality. The google_key will allow you to
use google maps to put data points in the notes. To get a key you must sign in
at [1]. You have to use your google identity and subscribe the key for a
particular server. I have selected one for myself for the server at 127.0.0.1
which is good enough for this application. The calendar url can be found in [2]
and follow the procedure. Dont get the frame, just the url loaded in the frame.

Finally, to run

./script/server
