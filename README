ยง To run:

./script/server

read to modify its configuration parameters

ยง To configure edit config/config.yml. It is yaml. You have to define
google_key and calendar_url. To get your calendar url you have to go to

http://www.google.com/support/calendar/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=41207

and follow the procedure. Dont get the frame, just the url loaded in the frame.

To get the google key for the maps functionality, go to

http://code.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html

and get one. Remeber it depends on the url of the server (I have one for
127.0.0.1 and works locally). The syntax of the yaml file is:

google_key: "here put the key"
calendar_url: "here put the url"
